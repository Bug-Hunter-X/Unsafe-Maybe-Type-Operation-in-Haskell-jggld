This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation on a Maybe type without proper handling:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = Just 5
  let y = Nothing
  print $ x + y
```

This will result in a runtime error because the `+` operator is not defined for `Maybe` types.  It tries to add a `Just` value to `Nothing`, failing.
