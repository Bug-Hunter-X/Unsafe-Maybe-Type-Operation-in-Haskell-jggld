The solution uses pattern matching to safely handle `Maybe` values:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = Just 5
  let y = Nothing
  case (x, y) of
    (Just a, Just b) -> print $ a + b
    _ -> print "Cannot perform addition: one or both values are Nothing"
```

This corrected code uses pattern matching to check if both `x` and `y` contain `Just` values before attempting the addition. If either is `Nothing`, it prints an informative message instead of crashing.
